## OneTrainer PyQT6 Mock-up

This is a mock-up implementation of the graphical user interface in QT6 for [OneTrainer](https://github.com/Nerogar/OneTrainer).

It is a Model-View-Controller architecture which should simplify development and provide performance improvements, over the current TKInter implementation.

At the moment the views are mostly complete (missing: canvas drawing, tooltips, some custom widgets, minor aesthetic changes).
Controllers are basic stubs to show interactions, but do nothing.
